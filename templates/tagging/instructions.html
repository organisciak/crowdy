	<p>Label each of the images below with at least two tags. A tag is a short word or phrases describing what is in the image.</p>

	<p> Good and interesting tags describe actions and objects in the image. e.g. "seagull", "running", "cats"</p>
	<p>Bad tags don't describe what is in the image, describe things too generally (e.g. 'blue', 'person'), or describe things that are not the focus of the image (e.g. tagging an image of a surfer as "water").</p>
	<p>One way to think of good tags is to consider, "if somebody was searching for this word, would this be an image that they'd want to find?"</p>
